AccountingBase (AccBase) - a free project to create an accounting framework (platform) under the GPL.

The project is conceived as a platform, basis of accounting, as much as possible untied from the nuances and details of accounting and tax legislation of any particular country (for example, the author of the project is in the Republic of Kazakhstan). For this purpose, a unique structure of the application account database has been created, which has no analogues in other accounting programs. Accounting is understood in the broadest sense - as financial, managerial, CRM, budget, etc. type of accounting. Any individuals and organizations are entitled to take AccBase as the basis for their projects and / or products.

It is assumed that AccBase is used primarily for personal purposes by those who are not completely satisfied with the existing accounting programs and / or the conditions of their support and licensing. Author AccBase in any case offers all its help and support.

It is assumed that the development of the project can branch out and go in any country, including the countries of the former Soviet Union. Thanks to the free GPL license, anyone can create products based on AccBase, and use AccBase in the accounting of any person or enterprise.
